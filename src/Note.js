        <h1>Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
            </b>.</h1> 
           <p> The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
            learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.</p>
            <br/><br/>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br/>

            <br/>I got to have hands on experience on:
            <li/>JavaScript
            <li/>HTML
            <li/>React.js
            <br/>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
            anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
